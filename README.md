# Auto-Encoder-and-image-Denoising-
This project focuses on the implementation of Auto encoders, a type of neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, this repository demonstrates how auto encoders can be used for Image Denoising—the process of removing noise from a corrupted image to reconstruct the original version.
